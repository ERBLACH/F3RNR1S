# [F3RNR1S] | Advanced Reconnaissance & Operational Logs

this is not a work of fiction. everything documented here is based on real-life events, technical audits, and field experience. no stories, just methodology.

### operational domains

**1. hardware & physical access (hid)**
if i have physical access, the system is mine. expertise in digispark, rubber ducky, and custom badusb payloads. i focus on bypassing edr/antivirus via keyboard emulation, achieving persistence in seconds, and lateral movement without leaving disk traces.

**2. signal intelligence (sigint)**
every wave carries data. monitoring 802.11 stack vulnerabilities, wpa2/wpa3 handshake capture, and deauthentication tactics. mapping urban wireless density to find the weakest entry point. if it broadcasts, it’s vulnerable.

**3. surgical osint**
i don’t need a name to find a target. i map digital shadows through leaked databases, metadata analysis, and social engineering surface mapping. i hack the human before i touch the machine.

**4. anti-forensics (zero-trace)**
the best operator is the one who was never there. in-memory execution, volatile storage utilization, and surgical log neutralization. designed to leave forensic teams with zero evidence.

### the f3rnr1s doctrine: the 3-week rule

speed is for amateurs; patience is for professionals. my methodology follows a strict 21-day cycle:

* **passive phase:** 21 days of pure observation. monitoring traffic patterns, system uptime, and user habits. zero packets sent, zero noise made. 
* **diagnostic entry:** once the gap is found, access is established. no destruction, no vandalism. the goal is to prove the architecture is compromised.
* **extraction & cleanup:** exit with total surgical precision. no alerts, no logs, no residues. "enter the system, analyze the core, leave it untouched."
